TYPING SPEED COUNTER


The "Typing Speed Tester" is an intuitive, interactive, and user-friendly digital tool designed to 
evaluate and enhance users' typing skills in real-time. This system provides a seamless platform that 
combines efficiency, accuracy, and engaging features to measure typing speed and accuracy. It 
integrates dynamic paragraph generation, error tracking, and real-time performance metrics such as 
Words Per Minute (WPM) and Characters Per Minute (CPM). Developed using HTML, CSS, and 
JavaScript, the Typing Speed Tester emphasizes responsive design and a streamlined user 
experience. By presenting users with randomized text passages to type, the system effectively tracks 
errors, time elapsed, and progress through visual cues. With a focus on adaptability and scalability, 
the Typing Speed Tester accommodates various user skill levels, making it suitable for both 
beginners and advanced typists. It promotes learning and improvement by providing immediate 
feedback on performance and highlighting areas requiring attention. This project aims to address 
the challenges of traditional typing practice methods by leveraging modern web technologies to 
create a reliable, engaging, and accessible solution that aligns with the demands of technology
driven learning environments.
